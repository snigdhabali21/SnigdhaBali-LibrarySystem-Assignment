# Library Management API

**Submitted by:** Snigdha Bali  
**Assignment:** FastAPI Intern Assignment  
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, Python, Postman, SwaggerUI 

##  Project Overview

This project is a **Library Management Backend API** built using **FastAPI**.  
It supports managing **Authors, Categories, and Books**, enforces **authentication using HTTP middleware**, and provides **business insights** through aggregated reports.
All routes are **protected by authentication middleware**.  
The API is designed to be clean, extensible, and easy to test using Postman.

## Commands to run
1. Create a virtual environment and activate-venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install dependencies-pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the server- uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001 CRUD output can be checked in **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs because I have used SwaggerUI**
4. To check the middleware just remove the comments and run the server.
5. Use Postman to check if the authentication is working by entering the credentials.



## Implementation
CRUD features along with Insights(endpoint) for all the tables are implemented and can be checked in SwaggerUI.
